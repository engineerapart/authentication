# Next Passport Authentication
This library provides authentication for [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). It is tiny (by design) and uses [passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) to authenticate.

There are two components to this module:

 1. **server middleware** - configure passport middleware for the web-server.
 2. **client library** - autenticate and get credentials for client.

## Setup
To use this module, both the server and client needs to be setup. Look at the [example]() to see how it must be used.

## Config Object
